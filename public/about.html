                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>This is the about page of the Phone Book Application.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Functionality</h3>
                <p>This is a simple, yet fully functional application that allows insertion and deletion of 
                    phone book records to and from the database. Another functionality offered is filtering of
                    database records against the last name field. However, I was free to enrich the filter
                    functionality in such a way that it allows filtering against more than one last name, and
                    also filtering against last names that begin or end with a specified string.
                    For example if we specify a filter like "Pa...", app will return all the records
                    where last name begins with "Pa" (like "Pantic", "Paunovic"...). Similarly, if we specify a filter like "...ic", app
                    will return all records where last name ends with "ic" (like "Smiljanic", "Pantic"...).
                    If we want to specify more than one last name criteria, we must delimit them with semicolon character(";").
                    For example: "Djurkov;Pa...;...ic" will get all records where last name is "Djurkov" or last name
                    begins with "Pa" or last name ends with "ic".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Insertion of records into the database is done by submitting a manually populated form. Form validates
                    entries on the client side and allows submission only if all of the fields are populated with valid data.
                    Upon inserting a record, phone book is re-rendered with added information about the inserted record.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Deletion of records from the database is implemented so that it can delete multiple entries at once. Each
                    listed record in the phone book has a checkbox that can be checked. After interacting with "Delete selected"
                    submit button, all selected records will be deleted from the database and the phone book is re-rendered with
                    added list of deleted records.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Database consists of two tables: "persons" and "phone_numbers". It was designed like this in order to eliminate
                    redundancy of first_name and last_name entries, because one person can have many phone numbers
                    (person -> phone_number = one-to-many relationship). Both insertions of records to and deletions from the
                    database are performed on both tables and are executing checks in order to ensure consistency.
                    For example, if a user is inserting a phone number for a person that is already present
                    in the database, only phone_number will be inserted into "phone_numbers" table. Otherwise, new person
                    will be added to the "persons" table, and phone number will be added to the "phone_numbers" table.
                </p>
                <h3>Technologies used</h3>
                <p>This application was implemented using: Node.js environment with Express framework and MySQL database on the back-end side
                    and Pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript on the front-end side. No third party libraries or elements were used (apart from
                    Express framework and Google web fonts).
                </p>
                <h3>Implementation</h3>
                <p>
                    Application was built from zero. All code was written from scratch.
